### Project Description
Clickine Thedi is a playful Python game where users try to find an invisible button by clicking on the screen. After 20 attempts, the game reveals a humorous message and plays an animated GIF to tease the user for wasting time. With expressive emojis raining in the background. Built using Tkinter and Pillow.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are too busy doing useful things. Clickine Thedi fixes that by giving them something totally pointless to do ‚Äî clicking around to find a button that doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs fun, silly, and proudly useless.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a game that wastes your time on purpose and also helps to understand our patience capacity.
